# TypesenseWeb

TODO: This library is being parked at version `0.1.0`. This is just an empty Phoenix boilerplate. You'll see some changes once this version starts beyond that.

**Note**: the only place where ai is used/integrated is in PR reviews. I am NOT interested in adding/integrating ai generated code in my codebase, as this little library can be fit in my mental model. ai has it’s own great use case, it’s just that I wanted to be hands-on with these projects.
